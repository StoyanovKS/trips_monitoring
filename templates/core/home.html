<h1>Application for monitoring of the costs generated by your trips</h1>
<p>Track trips, refuels and underlying expenses.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Who may find this application useful?</h2>
<p>
    Most people remember the big costs (such as insurance or tax payments), but the day-to-day expenses are what silently add up.
    This logbook helps you keep a clean history of your driving and fuel spending, and turns it into monthly insights.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Add your cars</strong> in one place (garage) and keep mileage consistent.</li>
    <li><strong>Log trips</strong> with distance and date.</li>
    <li><strong>Log refuels</strong> with liters, price and total cost.</li>
    <li><strong>See reports</strong> that summarize monthly totals and trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you could get out of it?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clear view of your monthly fuel costs</li>
    <li>Better decisions about driving habits and routes</li>
    <li>History you can rely on (no more “I think it was around…”)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Quick Start!</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Add your car</strong><br>
        Go to the <a class="quick-link" href="{% url 'car-list' %}"><em>Cars</em></a> section and register your vehicle with its current mileage.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Log trips and refuels</strong><br>
        Record each <a class="quick-link" href="{% url 'trip-list' %}"><em>Trip</em></a> and <a class="quick-link" href="{% url 'refuel-list' %}"><em>Refuel</em></a> to keep mileage and fuel costs in sync.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Check your reports</strong><br>
        Open <a class="quick-link" href="{% url 'monthly-report' %}"><em>Reports</em></a> to see monthly summaries and total fuel spending.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    That’s it. The more consistently you log data, the more accurate your insights become.
